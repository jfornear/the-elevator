  - Number of elevators
  - Number of floors
  - Zone definitions and ranges
  - Basic performance parameters
- Add environment variable support
- Implement configuration validation

### System Reliability
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement system health monitoring
- Add basic logging metrics
- Improve request queue optimization

### Testing
- Add load testing for concurrent requests
- Implement performance benchmarks
- Add integration tests for multi-elevator scenarios

## Priority 2: User Experience & Performance

### User Interface
- Add wait time estimates
- Implement mobile interface
- Add voice announcements
- Improve visualization

### Performance
- Smart floor skipping during peak hours
- Variable elevator speeds
- Energy usage optimization
- Improved zone-based distribution

### API
- Basic authentication
- Rate limiting
- WebSocket support
- API documentation

## Priority 3: Advanced Features

### Smart Systems

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Each improvement should:
   - Include tests
   - Update documentation
   - Maintain compatibility
   - Follow code style

2. Development Process:
   - Design first
   - Team review
   - Small, testable changes
   - Add monitoring
