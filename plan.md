# Elevator System Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation

1. Core Features
   - Multiple elevator cars (6 elevators)
   - 50 floors support
   - Up/down movement
   - Floor request handling (internal and external)
   - Door operations (open/close)
   - Zone-based operation (each elevator serves specific floors)

2. Request Management
   - Internal requests (from inside elevator)
   - External requests (from floor buttons)
   - Request queue optimization
   - Zone-based request distribution

3. State Management
   - Elevator states (moving, idle, door open/closed)
   - Current floor tracking
   - Direction tracking
   - Door state tracking
   - Target floor management

4. Visualization
   - Real-time system status display
   - Elevator position tracking
   - State and direction indicators
   - Target floor display

## Technical Implementation

1. Class Structure
   ```python
   class Elevator:
       # Core elevator logic and state management
       # Handles movement, requests, and safety features
   
   class ElevatorSystem:
       # Multi-elevator coordination
       # Request distribution and zone management
   
   class Request:
       # Request data structure with type and direction
   
   class Floor:
       # Floor-specific information
   
   class ElevatorVisualizer:
       # Real-time system visualization
   ```

2. Key Methods
   - `move()`: Handle elevator movement
   - `process_requests()`: Handle request queue
   - `add_request()`: Add new requests
   - `update_state()`: Update elevator state
   - `open_doors()`, `close_doors()`: Door operations
   - `can_serve_floor()`: Zone-based floor service check

## Current Assumptions

1. Physical Assumptions
   - Constant speed between floors
   - Fixed time for door operations
   - Single door per elevator
   - All floors are equidistant

2. Operational Assumptions
   - First-come-first-served basis with zone optimization
   - No power failures
   - No network communication delays
   - Each elevator serves specific zones
   - System starts from ground floor

## API Integration Plan

1. REST API Endpoints
   ```
   GET /system/status
   GET /elevator/{id}/status
   POST /elevator/{id}/request
   POST /floor/{number}/request
   GET /system/statistics
   POST /system/emergency
   ```

2. WebSocket Events
   ```
   elevator_moved
   doors_opened
   doors_closed
   request_added
   request_completed
   system_status_update
   ```

3. Integration Features
   - Real-time status updates
   - Request management
   - Emergency controls
   - System monitoring
   - Analytics and reporting

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests (Implemented)
   - Elevator core functionality
   - System management
   - Request handling
   - State transitions

2. Integration Tests (Future)
   - Multi-elevator scenarios
   - Zone coordination
   - API endpoints
   - WebSocket events

3. Performance Tests (Future)
   - Multiple simultaneous requests
   - System under load
   - Response times
   - Resource usage

## Development Environment

1. Requirements
   - Python 3.8+
   - pytest for testing
   - typing for type hints
